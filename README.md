# DevBox IDE

## Overview

Introducing DevBox, the evolution of the prototype IDE previously called CloudStudio. This new version represents a substantial refactor, packed with an array of innovative features currently in alpha.

Features of DevBox include:

- Enhanced syntax highlighting for ObjectScript classes
- Autocomplete functionality
- Dynamic code explorer
- Import and export support
- Code search across multiple files
- Integrated Code runners
- Integrated Code runners upon compilation with support for continuous unit testing
- A built in Code Assistant that leverages on GPT
- Live CSP preview solution

The primary goal of DevBox is to offer a lightweight, efficient IDE that functions effortlessly behind firewalls, within deeply nested RDP enclaves, and on secured servers.

Our secondary objective is to optimize DevBox for fast-paced development, continual testing, simplified version control, and to facilitate controlled deployments of ObjectScript solutions.

We also have immediate plans to introduce a secondary "connection manager" project, designed to simplify the process of installing and managing DevBox across a multitude of servers.

## Where can I find the documentation?

The complete documentation for DevBox is currently in development and will be made available at the earliest. Today's release (2023-07-03) of the DevBox early alpha version will soon be followed by a detailed installation guide and further documentation within the week.
